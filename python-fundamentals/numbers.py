# Learning Python data types

# Integers
#
# x = 4         Positive Int
# y = -3938     Negative Int
# z = 0         Zero
#
# Float - To use float, add decimal
#
# x = 5.0       Positive Float
# y = -3484.5   Negative Float
# z = 0.0       Zero (shows as 0.0)
#
# Also supports complex numbers ex:
# x = 42j
#
# Integers/simple data types are objects under the hood
# you can create new ones by calling methods associated with their types, ex:
#
# type(x)
# >>> <class 'complex'>
#
# type(y)
# >>> <class 'float'>
#
# a = 1
# type(1)
# >>> <class 'int'>
#
# int(5)
# >>> 5
#
# float(3.0)
# >>> 3.0
#
# x = 5
# y = 3.0
# x + y
# >>> 8.0
#
# 6 / 2
# >>> 3.0   Ints divided created a float
#
# 3 * 3
# >>> 9
