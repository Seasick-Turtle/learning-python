# Sets
#
# *********************************************************************************
#
#
# Sets are a datatype that allows you to store other immutable types in an unsorted way.
# An item can only be contained in a set once. There are no duplicates allowed
# The benefits from a set are: very fast membership testing along with being
# able to use powerful set operations like union, difference, and intersection
#
# They're used to store immmutable data types uniquely, it's easy to compare the items
# in a set
